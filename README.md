# St.Petersburg-Paradox
Classical statistic problem saying that a casino offers the following game.
- A fair coin is flipped repeatly
- Initial stake is $2
- Every time 'head' appears, the stake is doubled
- The first time 'tails' appears, the game stops and you win all that is in the pot

The implementation contains a simulation with this game and outputs the player number that won the jackpot (threshold).
